# Integrate a wordpress theme for a client.
### Step 1: Install WordPress and a theme
#### Chalets and Caviar, an agency in Aspen, Colorado, has hired you to create their website. It has around 15 luxury chalets for sale and other chalets available to rent.

####They want a "clear, uncluttered, design that exudes luxury." You'll have to offer them this result via a WordPress.


### In the project, you'll add:

- A dozen chalets total, with a mix of for sale and for rent (make them separate!)
- A contact page with contact details and a functional contact form
- A WordPress theme that makes logical sense for the client's requests
- The website will actually be online so that the agency can see it!

### Step 2: Configure access and documentation
The agency is satisfied with your initial proposal but asks you how to add, edit, and delete chalets from their listings. You will need to create:

- An administrator account for the agency director
- An administrator account for the developer (you!), if it does not already exist
- Editor accounts for two other agency employees
